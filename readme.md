I am a Sr.ML reserach engineer at Bose Research, where I work on research and development of NLP and audio applications. Previously I was a Collaborator and Researcher at the Music Technology Group (MTG), Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. I received my Ph.D from Georgetown University[GUCL Group, CorpLing Lab] with a focus on Computational Linguistics. My research interest includes machine learning and deep learning for audio (speech, music, environmental audio understanding), natural language processing (NLP), speech prosody, and computational musicology.
